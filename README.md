I was tasked with building a Sales Performance and Profitability Dashboard for a retail company. The goal is to analyze product sales, profits, and regional performance, and display the data in a dynamic and interactive dashboard that updates as new sales data is entered.

Portfolio Project Deliverables:

Dynamic Dashboard: A fully functional sales performance dashboard with interactive charts and pivot tables.

Key Insights: Document key business insights such as:

Which products/categories are driving the most sales?

Which regions are the most profitable?

Are there seasonal trends in sales performance?
